# Assertion-Based-Verification-of-FIFO
This project designs and verifies an 8-bit wide, 16-depth synchronous FIFO in Verilog. A SystemVerilog testbench applies reset, writes, and reads beyond capacity to test overflow/underflow. Assertions ensure no write on full, no read on empty, and flags never conflict. Simulation in Vivado confirms correct behavior.

ðŸ”¹Objective
The goal of this project was to design a synchronous FIFO (First-In First-Out) memory buffer and verify its functionality using Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) methodology in SystemVerilog. Assertions were used to capture design intent and automatically check corner-case scenarios like overflow, underflow, and protocol violations.

ðŸ”¹ FIFO Design (RTL)
Implemented a synchronous FIFO with parameters:
Data width: 8 bits
Depth: 16 locations
RTL included:
Write pointer & Read pointer management
Full and Empty flag generation
Synchronous read/write operations
Coded in Verilog and simulated in Xilinx Vivado.

ðŸ”¹ Verification Methodology
Built a SystemVerilog testbench with clock/reset generation, stimulus, and coverage points.
Applied Assertion-Based Verification (ABV) to validate FIFO properties.
Key Assertions Used:
No write when FIFO is full â†’ prevents overflow.
No read when FIFO is empty â†’ prevents underflow.
Full and Empty flags cannot be high simultaneously â†’ ensures pointer logic correctness.
Data integrity â†’ data read must match data written (checked via scoreboard).

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes
Assertions successfully caught illegal conditions during corner-case simulation.
Improved verification efficiency by automatically detecting protocol violations without manual waveform debugging.
Demonstrated strong understanding of FIFO design, Verilog RTL coding, SystemVerilog assertions, and modern verification practices.
